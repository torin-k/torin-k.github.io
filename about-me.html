<p>My name is Torin Kovach, and I’m currently an undergraduate at the Carnegie Mellon University <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/">School of Computer Science</a>. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/bs-in-artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>, one of the first of its kind!<br>
Outside the classroom, I enjoy coding, playing tennis and pickleball, biking, and fishing.</p>
<p>Right now (as of Sep 2023), I’m working with Alloy Therapeutics in bioinformatics and ML, doing some really exciting stuff with <a href="nature.com/articles/nrneurol.2017.148">antisense oligonucleotides</a>!</p>
