<p>I recently (May 2024) graduated from the Carnegie Mellon University <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/">School of Computer Science</a>, pursuing a degree in <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/bs-in-artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>, one of the first of its kind.</p>
<p>For fun, I enjoy tennis, biking, fishing, and snowboarding!</p>
<p>Recently, I worked with <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~fah/home.html">Fah Sathirapongsasuti</a> on a new company in the bioinformatics + ML space, doing some really exciting stuff with <a href="nature.com/articles/nrneurol.2017.148">antisense oligonucleotides</a>!</p>
<p>My last semester at CMU, I really enjoyed TA-ing for <a href="https://machinelearningcmu.github.io/S24-10707/">10-707, Advanced Deep Learning</a> with Prof. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russ_Salakhutdinov">Russ Salakhutdinov</a>.</p>
