<p>My name is Torin Kovach, and I’m currently an undergraduate at the Carnegie Mellon University <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/">School of Computer Science</a>. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/bs-in-artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>, one of the first of its kind!<br>
Outside the classroom, I enjoy tennis, biking, fishing, and snowboarding.</p>
<p>Right now (as of Jan 2024), I’m working with <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~fah/home.html">Fah Sathirapongsasuti</a> on a new company in the bioinformatics + ML space, doing some really exciting stuff with <a href="nature.com/articles/nrneurol.2017.148">antisense oligonucleotides</a>!</p>
<p>I’m also excited to be TA-ing for <a href="https://machinelearningcmu.github.io/S24-10707/">10-707, Advanced Deep Learning</a>, this semester!</p>
