# About Me
My name is Torin Kovach, and I'm currently an undergraduate at the Carnegie Mellon University [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/). Currently, I am pursuing a degree in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/bs-in-artificial-intelligence/), one of the first of its kind!
Outside the classroom, I enjoy coding, playing tennis and pickleball, biking, and fishing.

Right now (as of Sep 2023), I'm working with Alloy Therapeutics in bioinformatics and ML, doing some really exciting stuff with [antisense oligonucleotides](nature.com/articles/nrneurol.2017.148)!
