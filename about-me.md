# About Me
I recently (May 2024) graduated from the Carnegie Mellon University [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), pursuing a degree in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/bs-in-artificial-intelligence/), one of the first of its kind.

For fun, I enjoy tennis, biking, fishing, and snowboarding!

Recently, I worked with [Fah Sathirapongsasuti](https://cs.stanford.edu/~fah/home.html) on a new company in the bioinformatics + ML space, doing some really exciting stuff with [antisense oligonucleotides](nature.com/articles/nrneurol.2017.148)! 

My last semester at CMU, I really enjoyed TA-ing for [10-707, Advanced Deep Learning](https://machinelearningcmu.github.io/S24-10707/) with Prof. [Russ Salakhutdinov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russ_Salakhutdinov).
