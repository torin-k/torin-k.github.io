# About Me
My name is Torin Kovach, and I'm currently an undergraduate at the Carnegie Mellon University [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/). Currently, I am pursuing a degree in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/bs-in-artificial-intelligence/), one of the first of its kind!
Outside the classroom, I enjoy tennis, biking, fishing, and snowboarding.

Right now (as of Jan 2024), I'm working with [Fah Sathirapongsasuti](https://cs.stanford.edu/~fah/home.html) on a new company in the bioinformatics + ML space, doing some really exciting stuff with [antisense oligonucleotides](nature.com/articles/nrneurol.2017.148)!
