### Boolean Circuits! (5/3/2021)
My most recent project is an investigation into Boolean circuits. Not only is this model of computation exceedingly easy to reason about and work with, but it can be harnessed to help prove some of the most essential theorems and tackle some of the biggest questions in theoretical computer science. For the final project of [15-251](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15251/), I wrote a paper investigating and showcasing some of the central proofs related to Boolean circuits. I also came up with a few interesting exercises! You can view the document [here](http://torink.me/SERVER/Boolean%20Circuits!.pdf).

### Maze Maker (1/2/2021) 
Graphs are one of the most essential data structures in computer science, and can be found in tons of applications in the real world, from search engines to GPS navigation to recommender systems. One fun application of graphs is that by generating trees (a type of graph that fulfills certain requirements), we can create mazes. By the nature of trees, these mazes we generate only have a single solution! Using Python and a simple graphics library, I was able to quickly implement a maze generator:

As we increase the number of vertices in our tree, we increase the size of the maze. In a matter of minutes, we can create mind-bogglingly large mazes!

### Numerical Linear Algebra (12/15/2020)
For the final project of [21-241](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/melloncollegeofscience/departmentofmathematicalsciences/courses/), Matrices and Linear Transformations, my partner and I decided to investigate the area of numerical linear algebra, specifically
