# Projects

My most recent project is an investigation into Boolean circuits. Not only is this model of computation exceedingly easy to reason about and work with, but it can be harnessed to help prove some of the biggest theorems and tackle some of the biggest questions in theoretical computer science. For the final project of [15-251](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15251/), I wrote a paper investigating Boolean circuits and showcasing some of the most important proofs related with this
