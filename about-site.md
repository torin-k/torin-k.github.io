# About This Site
This website is created in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a text-to-HTML conversion tool, using [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) as a Markdown editor and to facilitate uploading to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This system provides a simple, clean, mobile-friendly design as well as a way to easily and quickly modify and add to this site from anywhere!

Update: As some problems have come up with StackEdit as documented [here](https://github.com/benweet/stackedit/issues/1780), I no longer recommend this as a reasonable way to make a small website!
