# About This Site
This website is created in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a simple text editing language which can be directly converted to HTML, using [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) as a Markdown editor and to facilitate uploading to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). See my repo [here](https://github.com/torin-k/torin-k.github.io) for the website code (all pretty much auto-generated).

### Pros:
- Super simple, clean layout with a mobile-friendly design
- Markdown makes it easy to edit pages, and StackEdit makes it easy to add/remove pages
- Can edit from anywhere without downloading the whole website locally (like a normal GitHub repo) due to StackEdit
- GitHub saves an exhaustive log of every published edit

### Cons:
- StackEdit is sometimes buggy, or won't work for a day or two
- Sometimes have to hack around StackEdit vs. GitHub Pages error
- Markdown pages are *too* simple for some's taste
