# About This Site
This website is created in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a simple text editing language which can be directly converted to HTML, using [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) as a Markdown editor and to facilitate uploading to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This system provides a simple, clean, mobile-friendly design as well as a way to easily and quickly modify and add to this site from anywhere!

### Pros:
- Super simple, clean layout with a mobile-friendly design
- Markdown makes it easy to edit pages, and StackEdit makes it easy to add/remove pages
- Can edit from anywhere without downloading the whole website locally (like a normal GitHub repo) due to StackEdit

### Cons:
- StackEdit
