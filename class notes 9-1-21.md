*Last class: definition of causality, necessity for causal view*

**Artificial intelligence** - imitating human behavior or computational rationality?
Three current problems:

 - Prediction - probability of `e1` given `e2` happens naturally
 - Intervention - probability of `e1` given we force `e2` to be true
 - Counterfactual - probability of `e1` if `e2` had been true, even though we know `e2` to not be true
Investigating causal structure:
- If `X` causes 

**Machine learning**:

 - Learning without being specifically programmed
 - Use data to improve knowledge via automated mechanisms

Three components of ML:

 1. Data - what information do we have, and is it useful?
 2. Task - what do we aim to produce (discriminative, generative)
 3. Algorithm - what mechanism do we actually use to leverage data to solve our task?

Three categories of ML:
 1. Supervised - given a set of labeled training data
	 - want to predict unseen examples well (avoid over/under-fitting)
	 - Nearest-neighbor, decision tree, regression, NN
 2. Unsupervised (GMM, K-means)
 3. Reinforcement - taught by the environment, learns via exploration
