**Artificial intelligence** - imitating human behavior or computational rationality?

**Machine learning**:

 - Learning without being specifically programmed
 - Use data to improve knowledge via automated mechanisms

 2. Task - what do we aim to produce (discriminative, generative)
 3. Algorithm - what mechanism do we actually use to leva
