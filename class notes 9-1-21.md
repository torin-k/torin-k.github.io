**Artificial intelligence** - imitating human behavior or computational rationality?

**Machine learning**:

 - Learning without being specifically programmed
 - Use data to improve knowledge via automated mechanisms

Three components of ML:

 1. Data - what information do we have, and is it useful?
 2. Task - what do we aim to produce (discriminative, generative)
 3. Algorithm - what mechanism do we actually use to leverage data to solve our task?

Three categories of ML:

 1. Supervised - 
 2. Unsupervised (GMM, K-means)
 3. Reinforcement - taught by the environment, learns via exploration
