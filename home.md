# Hi, I'm Torin!
My name is Torin Kovach, and I am interested in data-driven approaches to solve complex real world problems. I recently graduated from the Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science, majoring in Artificial Intelligence. This is a place where I can share some of my projects, ideas, and other fun things I'm working on.
